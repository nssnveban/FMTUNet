## 📖 Introduction

**FMTUNet** is designed to address the "accuracy bottleneck" in automated earth observation. Unlike lightweight models that sacrifice detail for speed, FMTUNet prioritizes **segmentation precision and boundary integrity**, making it ideal for high-quality offline mapping tasks.

It reconstructs the multi-modal interaction paradigm by synergizing:
1.  **Synergistic Mamba Fusion (SMF):** Exploits the linear-complexity selective scan of Mamba for dynamic, long-range feature alignment between Optical and DSM data.
2.  **Global Modeling Module (GMM):** Utilizes **Hybrid Deformable Attention (HDA)**. While computationally intensive, this mechanism is critical for capturing the irregular geometries (e.g., distorted building footprints) that standard fixed-grid attention misses.

**Performance (mIoU):**
*   **ISPRS Vaihingen:** 84.31% 
*   **ISPRS Potsdam:** 86.32%

## 💻 System Requirements

This model is optimized for **accuracy-critical applications** in geosciences. Due to the sophisticated attention mechanisms and high-resolution inputs, it requires a robust hardware environment.

*   **OS:** Linux (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 recommended). *Windows support for `mamba-ssm` is experimental.*
*   **GPU:** NVIDIA GPU with **Compute Capability ≥ 8.0** (Ampere architecture or newer).
*   **VRAM:** 
    *   **Training:** ≥ 24GB (e.g., RTX 3090/4090, A100/A800) is strongly recommended.
    *   **Inference:** ≥ 12GB.
*   **CUDA:** 11.8 (Strictly required for the provided installation steps).

## 🛠️ Installation

To ensure reproducibility, please follow these steps strictly to configure the Mamba environment.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/FMTUNet.git
cd FMTUNet
```

### 2. Create Environment
```bash
conda create -n fmtunet python=3.10
conda activate fmtunet
```

### 3. Install PyTorch (CUDA 11.8)
Note: We use PyTorch 2.1.1 which is compatible with Mamba 2.2.2.
```bash
pip install torch==2.1.1 torchvision==0.16.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### 4. Install Mamba-SSM & Dependencies
This step requires nvcc (CUDA compiler) to be available in your path.
```bash
# Install core libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Mamba components
pip install causal-conv1d==1.4.0
pip install mamba-ssm==2.2.2
```

## 📂 Data Preparation

We use the **ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Challenge** datasets (Vaihingen & Potsdam). Due to license restrictions, we cannot distribute the data directly.

1.  Request the data from the [ISPRS Official Website](https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/default.aspx), or can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/docs/en/user_guides/2_dataset_prepare.md#prepare-datasets)
2.  Organize the data as follows:

```text
